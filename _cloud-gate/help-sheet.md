Use the example character sheet to help build your character sheet. Name the text file `character-name.yml`. (e.g. `jules-burnbright.yml`) and send it to me (ed) on Discord.
The values in the main part of the sheet are the original values without experience, add all experience to the bottom `Experience` section (note the dashes).
If you have spent experience to gain a trait at level 1, then add the trait in the main part of the sheet at level 0.
If you have any other traits that don't fit into the provided sections, then add a new section under `Advantages` and call it `Other Traits`.
